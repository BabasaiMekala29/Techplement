# Techplement
SpeakEasy chat application is built using a tech stack consisting of Express.js for the backend server, Node.js runtime environment, MongoDB for database storage, React.js for the frontend, and socket.io for real-time messaging.

# Frontend:
  React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for creating a dynamic and interactive frontend for the chat application.
  socket.io: A communication protocol that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers. It is utilized for instant messaging functionality.
  
# Backend:
  Express.js: A lightweight web application framework for Node.js, used to handle HTTP requests, routing and API endpoints.
  Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used to execute server-side code.
  MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing user information, messages, and other application data.
  JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Used for user authentication. JWT tokens are generated upon successful login and are included in subsequent requests for authorization.
  
# Features:
  User Authentication: Users can securely sign up and log in to the application using JWT-based authentication.
  Signup: New users can create an account by providing a unique username and password. Passwords are securely hashed before storing in the database.
  Login: Registered users can log in to the application using their username and password. Upon successful login, a JWT token is generated and sent to the client, which is then used for subsequent authenticated requests.
  Messaging: Authenticated users can engage in real-time messaging with other users. Messages are sent and received instantly, providing a seamless chatting experience.
  
# Workflow:
    User Signup:
        Users navigate to the signup page and provide their username and password.
        The backend validates the user input, hashes the password, and stores the user information in the MongoDB database.
        Upon successful signup, users are redirected to home page where chats are shown.
    User Login:
        Users enter their username and password on the login page.
        The backend verifies the credentials, generates a JWT token, and sends it back to the client.
        The client uses the JWT token for subsequent authenticated requests.
    Messaging:
        Authenticated users can view and initiate messaging.
        One cannot send message without successful login/signup.
        When a user sends a message, the client sends the message data to the server via a WebSocket connection.
        The server broadcasts the message and display it in the chat interface to all users over WebSocket, ensuring real-time delivery.
        
By incorporating these features and considerations, the chat application provides users with a secure and efficient platform for real-time communication while leveraging modern web technologies and best practices.
